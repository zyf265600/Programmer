# Background Knowledge for Resume

### The most important three things for web application:

- Frontend
- Backend
- DataBase



##### The connector between frontend and backend called **"API"**

- API - Restful

  @GET - 

  @POST - 

  @PUT -

  @DELETE - 

  frontend get the users' action and inform the backend (and/or database) to implment <u>business logics</u> by interface (API), and then return the result of aciton to frontend.



##### How "JSON" helps between FE and BE

JSON -> BE API



##### The connector between database and backend

```c++
string s1 = "INSERT INTO Customers (C1,C2,C3,C4) VALUES (1,1,1,1,)"
string s2 = "INSERT INTO Application (name, id, url) VALUES ("zhangsan", 18, "www.pronhub.com")"
  
void functioncallsql (string instream) {
  sql.call(instream); 
}

functioncallsql(s2);
```

The connector between backend and database called **Direct Call/ORM (Object Relatinoal Mapping)**





#### Backend

- **Junit: **purpose of unit testing is to examine the individual components or pieces of methods/classes to verify functionality, ensuring the behavior is as expected. The tester chooses inputs to explore particular paths, and determines the appropriate output.
